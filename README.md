# InterChat

## Introduction
InterChat is a fun simulated chatroom experience that I created to entertain the user. It appears to have
an "AI" component, but it is a story driven game. 

## Requirements

- Eclipse IED

## Installation

 STEP ONE: Go to https://github.com/stonesteadman/InterChat 
 
 STEP TWO: Download the Groot AI **zip folder**. 
 
 STEP THREE: Open it in your preferred IED (Eclipse).
 
 ## Use
 
 STEP ONE: **Open** the file and **run** the program. A console will appear.
 
 STEP TWO: The game will give an explanation of what it is, then give you instruction on **how to play**.
 
 STEP THREE: The game will prompt you with a **question**, to answer, **type 'y' or 'n'**. *Case sensitive*
 
 STEP FOUR: Play through the story.
 
 STEP FIVE: When the program says **PROGRAM TERMINATED** the game is over. 
 
 STEP SIX: To **play again**, enter run the program. (Repeat step one)
 
 Below is a full walkthrough of the game.
